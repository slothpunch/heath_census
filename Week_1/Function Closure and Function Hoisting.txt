Welcome to Function Closure
and Function Hoisting. After watching this video, you will be able to define function closure and
identify practical examples, explain the concept
of function hoisting, and differentiate between function closure and
function hoisting. In Javascript, a function
closure is a function that retains access to variables from its enclosing
function scope. Even after the
enclosing function has finished executing, closures allow you to
create private variables, implement data hiding, and maintain state
between function calls. Here's an example of
a function closure. In this example, inner function is a closure because it can access the outer var variable from its containing function, outer function, even after outer function has
finished executing. Now, let's explore why using function
closure is important. Closures allow you
to encapsulate data within a function scope. Creating a private
environment for variables. This is crucial for building modular and maintainable code. As it helps prevent
unintended interference or modification of variables
from outside the function. By using closures, you
can hide certain data and expose only the
necessary parts of your code's functionality. This is fundamental for creating clean and secure application
programming interface, or API's libraries and modules. Closures enable
functions to remember and maintain state
between function calls. This is valuable for tasks
like implementing counters, timers, or managing
application state in event driven programming. In this example,
the greet function takes a name parameter, and returns an inner
function, sayHello. The greeting variable is enclosed within the
scope of sayHello. Thanks to the closure, you can create
multiple greetings by calling greet with
different names, and each greeting retains
its specific name. When you invoke greet
John and greet Alice, they still remember their
respective name values, resulting in
different greetings. Let's now learn about
function hoisting. Function hoisting,
is a behavior in Javascript where
function declarations are moved to the top of
their containing scope during the compilation phase, allowing you to use a function before it's actually
declared in the code. This behavior only applies to function declarations,
not function expressions. Here's an example of
function hoisting. In this example, the
sayHello function is called before it's declared. But it works because function
declarations are hoisted to the top of their
containing scope during the compilation phase. It's important to note
that function expressions, where a function is
assigned to a variable, do not exhibit
hoisting behavior. For example, in the
above code, greet is a function expression
and is not hoisted. So calling it before the assignment will
result in an error. Let's now learn the importance
of function hoisting. Function hoisting
can make code more readable and self explanatory, by allowing you to use functions before they
are defined in the code. This can improve the
logical flow of your code, and make it easier
to understand. Hoisted functions can be defined at any point within
their containing scope, regardless of the order
in which they are called. This flexibility can be
helpful when structuring your code and organizing
related functions. Function hoisting is crucial
for recursive functions, as it allows the function to call itself within
its own definition. You can conditionally
execute functions based on certain criteria without having to define them in
a specific order. The main difference between function closure and
function hoisting, is that function closures
allow functions to maintain access to variables from
their containing scope. While function hoisting
is a behavior where function declarations
are moved to the top of their containing scope
during compilation, enabling functions
to be called before their actual declaration
in the code. However, it's important to use function hoisting
judiciously, and understand its behavior, as it may lead to
unexpected results, if not used carefully. In contrast, function closures
are a fundamental concept for creating isolated modular
and maintainable code, and are widely used in many
programming scenarios, including creating
private variables, event handling, and
maintaining state. Function closures, are essential
for data encapsulation, information hiding,
and state management. While function hoisting, is valuable for code
organization, order independence, and recursive functions, both concepts contribute to the power and flexibility
of Javascript. In this video, you learned that function closures and
Javascript retain access to variables from
their containing scope, even after the
containing function has finished executing. Closures enable
private variables, data hiding and state maintenance
between function calls. Function hosting and
JavaScript moves function declarations
to the top of their containing scope
during compilation, allowing functions to be used
before they're declared. And function hosting
improves code readability, order independence, and enables recursion and conditional
execution of functions.
